# twitter-clone
Welcome to my personal take on a small-scale on a clone of Twitter. The project is still in development phase.
This application is built with Django. If you want to try it out and provide feedback, the server must be run on a local machine following these instructions after cloning the repository:
poetry install \
poetry shell \
python manage.py makemigrations \
python manage.py migrate \
python manage.py runserver \
Click on the link within your terminal to access to the locally hosted server. \
enjoy!
